# Java cellular automata

Just Mucking about making a cellular automata modelling bacteria growing with a rudimentary contact dependant inhibition system.

Growth rate, nutrient requirements and T6SS effectiveness can all be changed and a trade off between these variables appears.

Different 'strains' are in different colours and the cells killed by the 'T6SS' flash in red.
